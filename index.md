### AI/ML for Wireless Communications • CSI Sensing • mmWave/6G Research

Welcome to my academic homepage.

I specialize in the intersection of **AI/ML**, **wireless communication systems**, and **CSI-based sensing**, with a focus on:

- CSI-based Human Activity Recognition  
- AI/ML for RF & Wireless systems  
- mmWave/6G wireless modeling  
- Multimodal Sensing (CSI + Vision)  
- Symbolic Regression & Temporal Modeling  

I am currently **seeking research opportunities** in Wireless AI, CSI Sensing, and 6G technologies.
