## AI/ML for Wireless Communications • CSI Sensing • mmWave/6G Research

Welcome to my academic homepage.

I specialize in **AI/ML**, **wireless communication systems**, and **CSI-based sensing**, with a focus on:

- CSI-based Human Activity Recognition
- AI/ML for RF & Wireless Systems
- mmWave/6G modeling
- Multimodal Sensing (CSI + Vision)
- Symbolic Regression & Temporal Modeling
- Agentic AI for HAR

I am currently **seeking research opportunities** in Wireless AI, CSI Sensing, Deep Learning, and 6G technologies.

Explore my **Research**, **Publications**, **Projects**, and **Teaching** pages to learn more.
