# Research

My research focuses on the intersection of **AI/ML**, **Wireless Communications**, and **Sensing**, particularly using Channel State Information (CSI) and multimodal data to understand real-world human and device behavior.

---

## 🔷 AI/ML for Wireless Communications
Developing machine learning architectures for:
- Wireless link quality prediction  
- Interference and desense analysis  
- 5G/6G PHY-layer modeling  
- CSI-driven activity classification  

**Techniques used:** LSTMs, LTC networks, Transformers, Symbolic Regression.

---

## 🔷 CSI-Based Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
Building systems that use WiFi CSI to identify human activities such as:
- Walking  
- Standing  
- Sitting  
- Falling  

Combined with:
- Vision Transformers  
- LLM-based reasoning  
- Timestamp-synchronized fusion models  

This includes dataset generation using cameras + CSI, multi-camera setups, and automated labeling pipelines.

---

## 🔷 mmWave & 6G Link Prediction
Research on:
- Multi-link mmWave quality forecasting  
- Sub-THz channel behavior  
- Beamforming prediction  
- Link stability modeling  

Using hybrid models like LTC + LSTM + Symbolic Regression (from my ANTS publication).

---

## 🔷 Multimodal Fusion (CSI + Vision)
Developing architectures that fuse:
- CSI features (amplitude, phase)  
- Video-based features (ViT/ResNet)  
- LLM-based decision-making  

Used for fall detection, safety monitoring, and context-aware human sensing.

---

## 🔷 RF Test & Desense (Industry Experience)
At Apple (via OSI Engineering), worked on:
- Cellular RF desense  
- LTE/5G throughput validation  
- WiFi/BT coexistence  
- Spectrum/VNA/RF analyzer workflows  
- Automated RF logging using Python, Shell, TCL
