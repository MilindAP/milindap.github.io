# Projects

A selection of projects I have developed in AI/ML, Wireless Communications, and Sensing.

---

## 🔶 CSI + Vision Multimodal HAR System
A complete human activity recognition pipeline using:
- WiFi CSI extraction  
- Video frames from a synchronized camera  
- Timestamp alignment  
- CSI-based LLM classification  
- Vision-based VLM classification  
- Agentic AI decision fusion  

Tech stack: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, HuggingFace, FastMCP, Twilio SMS Alerts.

## 🔶 mmWave Multi-Link Quality Prediction (Published in IEEE ANTS)
Developed hybrid AI models (LTC + LSTM + Symbolic Regression) to:
- Predict mmWave link behavior  
- Interpret model decisions  
- Improve robustness of 5G/6G networks  

---

## 🔶 CSI–Image Dataset Generator
System for synchronized dataset creation:
- Extracts CSI packets from WiFi AP  
- Captures frames from multi-camera setup  
- Aligns timestamps  
- Stores annotated CSI–image pairs  
- Generates datasets for multitask HAR

## 🔶 UAV Path Planning Using CNN Scene Understanding
Deep learning model to:
- Analyze environmental scenes  
- Generate safe navigation paths  
- Support autonomous UAV flight  

Submitted to MDPI Sensors.

## 🔶 Apple RF Desense Testing (Industry)
Automated test workflows for:
- Cellular throughput  
- LTE/5G NR CA combinations  
- RF desense validation  
- Coexistence scenarios (WiFi/BT/Cellular)  
Using spectrum analyzers, VNAs, and automation tools.
